List and explain the JavaScript methods that enable us to select elements from the DOM.

document.getElementById('') selects the passed in identifier in your HTML by the ID you assign to a particular single element. For example <p id="test">123</p> You would pass in "test"
so that you can target the stuff inside of the paragraph. 

document.getElementByClassName('') targets a collection of elements that you have assigned with the named class.  
For example passing in "test1" will select all list items below
<div>
    <li class="test1"></li>
    <li class="test1"></li>
    <li class="test1"></li>
</div>

document.getElementByTagName('') targets all the elements in your HTML doc by their tag. Examples: <p></p>, <li></li>, <div></div>, <h1></h1>

What are the differences between the innerHTML and textContent properties in the DOM?

textContext will only get the content of the html, whereas innerHTML gets the content and the HTML code.

Event Listeners: These are methods to handle "events"/ trigger some code you want to run when some action is taken by the user. For example clicking on a button to create a text
pop up window. Or mousing over the button to change its color
